            Hotdog roll-ups are like the snack version of a hot dog. <br>
            They're cheesy, crispy, and super easy to make. <br> You wrap a hotdog in bread
            or dough, cook it up, and boom! Instant comfort food.
        </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Hotdog roll-ups are what happen when comfort food meets lazy-day creativity.<br>
            It's the kind of snack you throw together when you're not in the mood to cook but still want something warm, tasty, and satisfying.<br>
            There's nothing fancy about them, no fancy ingredients and no measuring. Simply good vibes and guilty goodness.<br>
            Whether you're feeding a bunch of friends or just raiding the fridge solo, they hit a perfect spot for indulgence.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 (1-ounce) slices white bread (such as Wonder Bread®)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
            <li>4 thin slices sharp Cheddar cheese, halved</li>
            <li>8 beef hot dogs (such as Oscar Mayer® Classic Wieners Hot Dogs)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons minced yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish</li>
            <li>1/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry's®)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <br>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, roll each bread slice until entirely flat. <br>
                Trim just the crust off each bread slice, forming a 4x4-inch square. <br>
                Spread each bread slice with an even layer of mustard (about 3/4 teaspoon per slice).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Working with 1 slice of bread at a time, place a halved cheese slice <br>
                on the edge of the bread closest to you; place 1 hot dog horizontally on <br>
                top of the cheese slice. If needed, trim the ends of the hot dog so that <br>
                no hot dog extends over edges of bread. Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons onion horizontally <br>
                across the cheese slice above the hot dog, followed by 1 teaspoon of relish.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Roll up tightly, applying gentle pressure to help seal the bread seams together. <br>
                Slice crosswise into 3 equal pieces (about 1 1/4-inches each), and transfer to a <br>
                serving platter. Repeat process with remaining ingredients. Preheat an air fryer <br>
                to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes, or according to manufacturer's <br>
                instructions. Lightly coat tops and sides of roll-ups with cooking spray. <br>
                Working in 2 batches, add roll-ups to basket, spacing them 1/2-inch apart, and <br>
                cook until bread is lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir together barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, and seasoned salt in a small bowl until evenly combined.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Serve hotdog roll-ups with mayonnaise mixture.</li>
        </ol>
