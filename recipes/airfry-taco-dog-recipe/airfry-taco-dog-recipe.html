    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A taco dog is what happens when you take a hotdog and give it a full-on taco makeover. <br>
            You start with a tortilla or bun, tuck in an airfried hotdog, and pile on all the good stuff! <br>
            In this recipe, that's salsa, guacamole, and jalapenos. You get the smoky and salty bite from the dog, <br>
            layered with freesh, spicy taco toppings that make every bite a little messy and very delicious. <br>
