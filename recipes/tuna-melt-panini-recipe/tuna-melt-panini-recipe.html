    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A tuna melt panini is one of those sandwiches that feels simple but totally delievers. <br>
            You mix canned albacore tuna with mayo, balsamic vinegar, chopped onion, and a bit <br>
            of dill pickle for a creamy, tangy filling. Combined with sourdough bread slices and <br>
            American cheese, the outside gets golden and crunchy. While the inside stays warm and gooey <br>
            with a tasty kick from the pickle and onion.
